1. What was the bug?

num1 and num2 were being read in as strings, so the addition simply concatenated the strings.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.

I would convert the num1 and num2 variables into numbers using Number().
